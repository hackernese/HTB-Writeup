    HackTheBox &middot; Writeups

</h1>
    <p align="center">HackTheBox writeups built by me to give whoever is interested in cyber security and pentesting the initial idea of how ti successfully own both user and root of a machine. I do try to put the instructions as detailed and as step-by-step as possible, if there is any confusion, issue it as will.</p>

<br>

> `UPDATE` : The majority of writeups have been and will be uploaded at my [official blog](https://blog.hackernese.com/). This repository is mainly used to host the exported PDF versions of the writeups as well as tools and scripts that were used during the pwning.

# Forewords

If you are new to HackTheBox, make you you register an account first [here](https://www.hackthebox.com/). Then try to understand what `OpenVPN` is and how to make a connection. Here is a decent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyqk4zl6eyU) on how that is done.
If you are still stuck, consider getting support at their official [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/hRXnCFA)
